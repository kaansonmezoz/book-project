# Summary

Book tracker web app made using Spring Boot and Vaadin 14 (only the free components will be used).

This app will let you:
- Add books that you have read to a 'read' shelf
- Add books that you are currently reading to a 'currently reading' shelf
- Add books that you would like to read to a 'want to read' shelf
- Add your own shelves
- View books in your different shelves and make changes
- And more!

(The image above may look slightly different to the app. If major changes are made, the image will be updated to reflect this.)
