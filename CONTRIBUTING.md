Firstly, thank you for taking an interest in contributing!

## Code of Conduct

By contributing to this project, you are expected to adhere to the [Book Project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

The code of conduct is updated from time to time, so please ensure you stay up-to-date.

## Suggestions and complaints

All suggestions and complaints are both welcome and encouraged. Please add to an existing relevant issue or make a new one.

## Before contributing

*This applies to both code and documentation changes.*

If an issue already exists for what you want to work and it is unassigned, feel free to assign yourself to it. If an issue doesn't already exist, please create one and assign yourself to it. 

Assigning yourself to an issue before working on it helps to minimise the chances of duplicated work.

## Git workflow

Please follow the process below:

1. Assign yourself to the relevant issue (see the *Before contributing* section)
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a new branch off master with a descriptive branch name
4. Submit a pull request to merge into master

Use the present tense (e.g. "add converter", not "added converter") for git commit messages.
