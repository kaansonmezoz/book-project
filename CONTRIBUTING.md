Firstly, thank you for taking an interest in contributing!

As with the code of conduct, this contributing document may change over time, so please ensure that you stay up-to-date with it. Multiple versions of this document may exist, so please always refer to the [version on the master branch](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Code of Conduct

By contributing to this project, you are expected to adhere to the [Book Project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## Suggestions and feedback

All suggestions and feedback are both welcome and encouraged. Please add to an existing relevant issue or make a new one.

## Before contributing

### Assign yourself to an issue

*This applies to both code and documentation changes.*

If an issue already exists for what you want to work and it is unassigned, and it is not labelled as `blocked`, feel free to assign yourself to it. If an issue doesn't already exist, please create one and assign yourself to it. 

Assigning yourself to an issue before working on it helps to minimise the chances of duplicated work.

### One problem per patch

For every patch you make, please ensure it solves one problem. If you want to solve multiple problems, please spread them across multiple patches -- one patch per problem.

## Git workflow

Please follow the process below:

1. Assign yourself to the relevant issue (see the *Before contributing* section)
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a new branch off master with a descriptive branch name
4. Submit a pull request to merge into master<sup>1</sup>

Use the present tense (e.g. "add converter", not "added converter") for git commit messages.

## Code contributions

Please adhere to [Google's Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

If you use IntelliJ, you can use the [google-java-format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) plugin to auto-format your code. Alternatively, if you use Eclipse, you can import [Google's Java XML file](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/eclipse-java-google-style.xml).

## Ways to contribute

- Code: adding new features, fixing bugs and general refactoring to name a few

- Documentation: improvements to files such as the README, any of the wiki pages, comments in source files, this document or the code of conduct

- Design: helping to design the UI and UX of the web app through prototypes (such as wireframes and drawings) or code changes in Vaadin or CSS

## Notes
1. Generally speaking. This may not be the case depending on the issue. Master may not contain the work that an issue is for, so a different branch may need to be targeted. The branch to merge into should be made clear from the issue. If in doubt, feel free to ask.
