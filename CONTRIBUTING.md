Firstly, thank you for taking an interest in contributing!

As with the code of conduct, this contributing document may change over time, so please ensure that you stay up-to-date with it. Multiple versions of this document may exist, so please always refer to the [version on the master branch](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/edit/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Code of Conduct

By contributing to this project, you are expected to adhere to the [Book Project Code of Conduct](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## Questions, suggestions & feedback

All questions, suggestions and feedback are both welcome and encouraged. Please add to an existing relevant issue or make a new one.

## Before contributing

### Assign yourself to an issue

*This applies to both code and documentation changes.*

If an issue already exists for what you want to work and it is unassigned, and it is not labelled as [blocked](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/labels/blocked), feel free to assign yourself to it. If an issue doesn't already exist, please create one and assign yourself to it. 

Assigning yourself to an issue before working on it helps to minimise the chances of duplicated work.

### One problem per patch

For every patch you make, please ensure it solves one problem. If you want to solve multiple problems, please spread them across multiple patches -- one patch per problem.

## Git workflow

Please follow the process below:

1. Assign yourself to the relevant issue (see the *Before contributing* section)
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a new branch off the branch that the issue specifies to branch from with a descriptive branch name that includes the issue number
4. Submit a pull request to merge into the branch specified on the issue

Use the present tense (e.g. "add converter", not "added converter") for git commit messages.

## Code contributions

Please adhere to [our Java style guide](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md).
